                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>The aim of this area of MDN is not to take you from "beginner" to "expert" but to take you from "beginner" to "comfortable." From there, you should be able to start making your way, learning from the rest of MDN, and other intermediate to advanced resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge.</p>

                <h3>Vission</h3>
                <p>A career in web development is challenging, financially rewarding, and has a lot to offer in terms of job security. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts 15% employment growth for web developers between 2016 and 2026—much faster than average—and web developer ranked as the 8th best job title in tech based on salary and employment rates.</p>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>After mastering the essentials of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you should learn about client-side web development tools, and then consider digging into client-side JavaScript frameworks, and server-side website programming.

            <p class="para01"p>Developer communities are types of marketing channels where peer-to-peer conversations and authentic engagement are most likely to take place. At the core, this is a place where the vast majority of the audience shares common traits and interests.</p>
